# Privacy Policy
This document entails the privacy policy and agreement that you accept when adding Hikin#8820 to a server, or as a member of such a server. This document does not supersede the [Developer Terms of Service](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/legal).

### Terminology
* **Server Manager** - Anyone who has the ability to add a bot to a server or configure the bot for the server. This is usually an administrator or moderator
* **Server Member** - Anyone who is a member of server to which one of the bots has been added
* **Third-Party Services** - Any service that is not directly affiliated with Wangsheng Funeral Parlor


## Data Collection

### Data Collected by Command
The following items may be collected and stored when intentionally provided by a user (usually by means of a command). This data will not be collected automatically. When providing data in this way, you forego any rights to the content of the data provided.
* Data and content for automated tasks (sticky messages)
* Channel identifier for sticky messages.


### Data Collected Automatically
* Guild identifier for guild specific settings.
* Any data needed for standard operation of Discord bots, such as server permissions (this data is stored in cache only while the bot is running).

*Apart from the data outlined above, no data is automatically collected.*


## Data Handling
* Collected data is stored and processed on protected servers. Please keep in mind that even with these protections, no data can ever be 100% secure. All efforts are taken to keep your data secure and private, but its absolute security cannot be guaranteed. 
* Bot Admins may access collected data to debug and fix any issues that may be caused by collected data.
* Collected data is not shared with any third-party services.
* Message content is matched against defined triggers and discarded right after.


## Removal of Data
* Manual removal of the data can be requested by joining the [Wangsheng Funeral Parlor](http://discord.gg/hutao) Discord server and submitting a Modmail.
* For security reasons will we ask you to provide us with proof of ownership of the server, that you wish the data to be removed of.
* Only a server owner may request manual removal of data and requesting it will result in the bot being removed from the server, if still present on it.

In addition, you (the server manager) are agreeing to inform your members of the [Developer Terms of Service](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/legal) and the contents of this document.
